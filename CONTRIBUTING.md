# Contributing to xlnt

xlnt welcomes contributions from everyone regardless of skill level (provided you can write C++).

## Getting Started

Look through the list of issues to find something interesting to work on. The issue description and labels should indicate the difficulty of implementation.

## Contributions

Contributions to xlnt should be made in the form of pull requests on GitHub. Each pull request will be reviewed and either merged into the master branch or given feedback for changes that would be required to do so. 

All code in this repository is under the MIT License. You should agree to these terms before submitting any code to xlnt.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e. each commit should compile and pass all tests). Commits that don't follow the coding style indicated in .clang-format (e.g. indentation) cannot be accepted.

- If your pull request is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed defect or new feature. It's best to do this before making any changes, make sure that the tests fail, then make changes ensuring that it ultimately passes the tests.

## Conduct

Just try to be nice--we're all volunteers here.


## Communication

Add a comment to an existing issue on GitHub, open a new issue for defects or feature requests, or contact @tfussell if you want.
