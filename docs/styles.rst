Introduction
------------

Styles are used to change the look of your data while displayed on screen.
They are also used to determine the number format being used for a given cell
or range of cells.

Styles can be applied to the following aspects:

   * font to set font size, color, underlining, etc.
   * fill to set a pattern or color gradient
   * border to set borders on a cell
   * cell alignment
   * protection
