Build configurations for Visual Studio, GNU Make, Ninja, and Xcode can be created using [cmake](https://cmake.org/) v3.2+. A full list of cmake generators can be found [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html). A basic build would look like (starting in the root xlnt directory):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

The resulting shared (e.g. libxlnt.dylib) library would be found in the build/lib directory. Other cmake configuration options for xlnt can be found using "cmake -LH". These options include building a static library instead of shared and whether to build sample executables or not. An example of building a static library with an Xcode project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D STATIC=ON -G Xcode ..
cmake --build .
cd bin && ./xlnt.test
```
*Note for Windows: cmake defaults to building a 32-bit library project. To build a 64-bit library, use the Win64 generator*
```bash
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
```
