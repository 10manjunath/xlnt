Introduction
------------

xlnt is a C++14 library for reading, writing, and modifying xlsx files as described in ECMA 376. 

The API is generally based on openpyxl, a python library for reading and writing xlsx/xlsm files. 

This is still very much a work in progress, but the core development work is complete.
